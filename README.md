  ## Tests


  ## Mvp
    An application that allows users to join and fill out a questionnaire that is based upon personality and categorization. The app will then match users based upon similar types of answers to the questionnaire. After matched the users will be directed to a live chat. The live chat will be similar to the concept of the dating game where one users is the admirer and 3 other users are trying to be picked by the admirer for a continuing 1 on 1 conversation.

  ## User_Stories
    As single person I am looking for a fun experience while searching for a potential partner
      So that when I am using this app I am matched with people with similar interest.
  ## Acceptance_Criteria
  GIVEN a Dating game app
  WHEN I visit the site
  THEN I am prompted to login or signup
  WHEN I signup for an account
  THEN I am prompted to fill out a form that saves my categorization and personality info
  WHEN I am finished filling out all the information  
  THEN I am able to choose between opening an empty room, going into an open chat forum with high compatibility users, or browse open rooms.
  WHEN I launch the open chat 
  THEN I am prompted to answer whether to be the admirer or the suitor
  WHEN If an admirer choices a suitor  
  THEN The admirer and suitor are put into an one on one chat
  WHEN if an admire doesn't choose a suitor 
  THEN The chat is ended
  WHEN If both the suitor and admirer choose to chat later
  THEN Their user information is stored in each others account to carry on conversations later
